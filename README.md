## Sarpinos Pizza
Sarpino's pizza is a pizza chain in the kc area that is probably my favorite pizza place **ever**. The pizza they have is so good. Most of the time if I'm just ordering for my self, I'll do a **calzone** specifically the buffalo chicken calzone.<br> 
***They also offer free delivery so and they are open till 2 am***
