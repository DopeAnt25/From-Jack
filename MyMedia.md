# Anthony Jack
So one of my favorite artist is this rapper Logic, he has a song that I love called can I kick it although I like all of his music, this one in particular I love. I love it so much that my freshman year here at northwest I wrote a paper about the song and him and his background.

| Title of the work | Why | The author |
| --- | --- | --- |
|X-Wing (song)| Because this song is just <br> so good, the bass the bars<br> that Denzel spits are just on<br> a whole new level. It really shows how good of a rapper Denzel truely is| Denzel Curry|
|One piece| I have to put one piece on here because it is literally one of the best pieces of fictions to ever exist. The way luffy always liberates the town he goes to and the animation is so clean!!!| Eiichiro Oda|
|Legend Of Zelda: Breath of the wild| This has been the game I've been playing the most of recently it's just a really good action RPG. Does a really good job with the map the story is incredible and the gameplay is amazing|Nintendo Entertainment Planning & Development|

# Code Fencing
This snippet of code is how you would merge two python dictionaries into one, or as many dictionaries that you have all into one big dictionary.
```def merge_dicts(*dicts):
  super_dict = {}
  for dict in dicts:
      for k, v in dict.items():
          super_dict[k] = v

 return super_dict
 ```
